The Land Registry System is a blockchain-based smart contract for secure and transparent land ownership management. It allows users to register land, verify ownership, and transfer property rights without intermediaries.

This smart contract is developed using Solidity on the Ethereum platform. It ensures that only unregistered land can be added and that only the current owner can transfer ownership. Anyone can verify land details directly on the blockchain.
